## Lists Philosophy

Lists is a project hosted on WikiMedia Labs. It's goal is to create a place where is possible to create, edit, analyze and run easily query and scripts to create lists of wiki pages.

The lists can be both for human-usage and for bot-usage.

At the moment only sql queries are supported and are run automatically by the system with a certain frequency.
